Requirements
Phase 3 Deliverable must contain the goal of this phase of the project, a description of the creation of the database schema and instance, and a description of the application programs. It must also provide any revisions made to the specifications described in the Phase 2 Deliverable. It must further describe the problems encountered in Phase 3 and justify the solutions.
Run SQL commands for creating tables, including primary keys, secondary keys, and foreign keys. Run SQL command files that populate each table. Each table is required to have a sufficient number of tuples. Keep in mind the relationships between tables and plan your data accordingly. You should be able to run these command files successfully with no errors and no integrity violations.
